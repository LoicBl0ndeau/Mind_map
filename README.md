# 🧠 Mind_map

**Mind_map** is a lightweight, visual mind mapping tool implemented with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to explore, edit, and view `.mm` mind map files (like those created with Freeplane or FreeMind) directly in the browser.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main web page.
- `script.js` — Handles loading and displaying `.mm` files as mind maps.
- `style.css` — Custom styles for the interface.
- `.mm` files — Example mind maps (`Fables.mm`, `test.mm`).
- `*.jpg/png` — Various images used for illustration or background.
- `*.ttf` — Fonts used in the application (`Louis George Cafe`).

## 🚀 Features

- Load and visualize `.mm` (mind map) files.
- Intuitive zoom and pan interactions.
- Clean UI with custom fonts and images.
- Compatible with Freeplane/Freemind mind map files.
